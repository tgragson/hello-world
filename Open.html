<p><strong>Department Policy<em>Open Access Author Fee Fund</em></strong></p>
<p>Open access (OA) journals provide an alternative scholarly publication outlet to traditional journals. OA journals offer peer review, production and distribution servicesbut do not charge subscription fees. They cover publication expenses through other sources including processing fees paid by or on behalf of authors publishing in the journal.An <em>open access author fee fund</em> is a pool of money that helps underwrite reasonable publication charges for articles published in fee-based OA journals.<strong>Eligible Publications</strong>Individuals may request assistance in covering the author fee for articles accepted for publication in peer-reviewed, open access journals that do not charge readers or their institutions for unfettered access to the published peer reviewed articles.Eligible journals must:</p>
<p>• Be listed in the <span class="underline">Directory of Open Access Journals</span> (DOAJ) • Be a member of the <span class="underline">Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association</span>(OASPA) or adhere to its <span class="underline">Code of Conduct</span>,</p>
<p><em>Or</em></p>
<p>• Be a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).</p>
<p>In addition, they must</p>
<p>• Make their standard fee schedules publicly accessible.</p>
<p>The fund will not support “hybrid” open access publishing in which individual articles from journals that are normally subscription access only are made openly available when author fees are paid.UGA Libraries has institutional memberships with the Royal Society of Chemistry and BioMedCentral, which UGA authors may want to consider for open access publishing. The former provides UGA authors free-of-charge open access publishing and the latter provides a 15% discount to those who publish in one of their open access journals.<strong>Eligible Authors</strong>Funds are available for faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students and staff directly affiliated to the Department of Anthropology - University of Georgia (i.e., must be a member of the personnel or in a degree-program in good standing). The applicant must be the corresponding author for the publication, and the article must indicate the corresponding author is affiliated with the Department of Anthropology - University of Georgia.<strong>Eligible Fees</strong>Eligible fees include publication fees levied on articles accepted for publication including the peer review management and journal production charges; they do not include, when separately expensed,color illustration fees, cost of reprints, non-OA page charges, web-hosting for self-archiving, etc. Eligible fees must be based on the standard and publicly accessible fee schedule for the publication.<strong>Fund Limits</strong>Production charges are paid to the publisher on behalf of an author on a first-come-first-served basis depending on the availability of funds.How to ApplyOnce an author has a manuscript accepted for publication by a qualifying journal and receives a statement or invoice for production charges, the author should submit a brief, written request to the Head. This request should include evidence of funding in hand to support the production fees or evidence the author has exhausted other funding venues (e.g., grants).The Head will review individual requests as received in a timely manner and consult with the Executive Committee on as needed basis. Priority will be given to early career authors who have not been previously funded in a given fiscal year. Individual authors may be supported up to $500 per year in publication fees.<strong>Multiple Authors</strong>In the case of multiple authors from different institutions, support for a Department of Anthropology - University of Georgia authorwill be prorated. The allowable amount will be determined by dividing the production fee by the number of authorsmultiplied by the number of Department of Anthropology - University of Georgia authors.<strong>Grant Funding</strong>Articles resulting from a current or recently ended grant that will cover publication fees (e.g., NSF) are not eligible for funding. Individuals seeking external funding for their research are strongly encouraged, when permissible, to include a line item for publication costs in all their proposals.</p>
